We were not able to test the speed updating probably because of some issues with localization on my (Francesco's) device. We tried really hard to make it work on the device, but the onLocationChanged callback it is never called. We implemented the functions following precisely the android documentation and looking for possible solutions on stackoverflow and other forums. Nevertheless, the problem remains and we do not have any clue for debugging it. We hope that is not a critical issue, we are really sorry.
Removing the speed check in the function activityRecognition the app works pretty fine.
